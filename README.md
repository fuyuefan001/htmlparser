CODE:


redditparser.py is based on reddit's official API and the data structure has been automatically build, 

the only thing I need to do is extract the text from the object. IT ONLY WORKS WITH REDDIT 


htmlparser.py is based on parsing the html script of a webpage, which can be applied to other kinds of websites other than reddits . 

you can search any data in the html scripts with specified 'attrs' and 'fields'

FOR EXAMPLE, THIS WORKS WITH AMAZON ITEM PAGE



OUTPUT:

redditcomment.txt is generated with redditparser.py
