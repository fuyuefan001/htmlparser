To be fair though, I haven't had enough time to do extended testing nor have I had time to play around with all the settings to fine tune my overclock as much as I like. I'm sure if I went with an open air bench or a more high airflow case instead of being thermally handicapped by a Define Mini C, I would have an even easier time of it. But, I'm a sucker for Fractal.

["I already had a MSI Z370 board, and I had the opportunity to sell my i7 8700k a few weeks ago- so I was waiting on this CPU.  With additional proceeds I got from selling a few other older components (SB sound card, and extra Hyper 212 cooler), this processor ended up costing me only about $25.  Very happy with it so far, but I haven't really pushed it hard with OC'ing.  Strangely it seems to be running just a little cooler, and is using a tad less voltage with the exact same set-up as I had with my i7 8700k.  I'm using a Corsair H115i and idle in the mid/low 20s (C).  Right now it's 25-26C across all 6 cores.  My ambient is pretty cool, usually about 22-23C so these temps are fine.

I like the nostalgic aspect to this proc, so I'm very pleased with this purchase.  Plus it's pretty much the best gaming processor money can buy.  I know there are going to be plenty of haters and AMD fanboys telling me how stupid it was to get this proc, but that makes me love it all the more.  Great Proc Intel!  Next week I'm going to see how well it does going over 5GHz.  Here it's at 5.0GHz on all 6 cores.", "Maybe it'll be worth some $ someday since it is a limited run."]
['Most excellent CPU, but as others have said, I have to knock off a star for how hot this thing runs. Intel\'s "toothpaste" between the die and heatspreader is just not acceptable.

No room for overclocking. Opted for a Noctua D15s, and things are very much under control now (iirc a short Aida64 cpu+fpu stress peaked around 75c but backed off to around 65-70). I'm still not comfortable overclocking unless I delid, but that's not something I've ever done before.", "Overall I'm impressed with performance though. I plan to keep this in my computer for quite a few years."]
