It's all a conspiracy theory, not much different from "VACCINES GIVE YOU AUTISM!!!"
____ Yep.  Started as a communist plot theory in the 50's, and has endured in one tin-foil hat way or another for decades.
____ ____ ..."our precious bodily fluids".  Kubrick was making fun of this Bircher idiocy fifty years ago. And it still won't die... 
____ ____ Nothing like good old misinformation.  
It's not.

However, a lot of people in the 50's and 60's (mostly conservatives and Birchers) resented the act of fluoridating water simply because they didn't have a *choice*. If you wanted to drink water, you were drinking fluoride. (Easily obtainable bottled water not exactly being a thing back then.) Basically, you weren't allowed to be against fluoride because the government was literally pouring it down your throat. Even though it's long past being a "thing," it still sticks around.

To be fair, there ARE issues with fluoride (bone formation, kidney issues, etc), and some people have fluoride sensitivity, so it's isn't universally helpful. And high levels of fluoride can be poisonous, and many people don't trust water companies to not accidentally (or not!) screw up the regulation of fluoride. Still, the benefits of fluoride are generally much better than the drawbacks, but there's a reason why people resent being forced into ingesting it.
In Australia we have flouride added to the water. There isn't any noticable negative effect aside from a generation with great teeth.
____ Goddamn government caring about peoples health.
____ ____ So you all think its okay to mess with the water supply because it supposedly gives you great teeth? [](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toU3qIR8xgw) Episode of Stuff They Don't Want You To Know on Fluoradation http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=toU3qIR8xgw
____ ____ ____ No "supposedly" about it.
____ ____ Yeah but it makes our tap water taste bad
Licensed water treatment operator here...... Fluoride only help developing teeth, it helps strengthen the enamel. It does nothing for teeth that have already popped out. The main pushers to add fluoride to water is the American Dental association  and is considered by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention as "one of 10 great public health achievements of the 20th century". Too much fluoride in developing teeth can cause fluorosis. The safe maximum level is considered 4parts a million or 4mg/L. You can go to your local water company to see what the fluoride level is in your water. There is in some parts of the country natural fluoride in the water...............Reverse osmosis doesn't remove all of the flouride. The only way to remove it all is to distill the water......here is a link to the CDC FAQ's about fluoride..... http://www.cdc.gov/fluoridation/faqs/wellwater.htm
____ Thank you. 
It's not. It's great for your teeth. 
It's really not. Fluoride in water correlates with better dental hygiene in many countries.

Here's a wikipedia link that's quite informative. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluoride_toxicity
so I don't think we know officially of any ill health effects from adding sodium fluoride to the water.   Florine is the most reactive naturally occurring element on the periodic table it's bound to a sodium ion so it does not eat your innards alive.  Most municipalities add a very small amount of this to their water.  Honestly, it's kind of silly compared to the long term use of toothpaste or those trays with fluoride in them they put in children's mouths at the dentist office.  Several kids have actually died from swallowing a full tray of those fluoride treatments at the detest.  Although, compared with the number of children we prevented deadly septic tooth abscesses in with the use of those treatments, it might be a wash.  sodium fluoride in our water systems do reduce tooth decay quite a bit in the US.  Tell her to look at the antibacterial agents Trycolsan and its' effects of human hormone levels and early puberty or have her read the book "Deamons in the Freezer" if she feels the need to be paranoid about something.  
____ No she's read enough of thoses
Regardless of any benefits to fluoridisation there is a very important point of principle. When you turn on the tap you should get clean drinkable water with the minimum of treatments to make it safe. When fluoride is added the water becomes a pharmacological preparation. It is wrong to make the water supply into a drug delivery system. If I'm told the water is fluoridated when on holiday or visiting friends I don't worry about it. It's still wrong though.
Too much of it, and the water tastes real bad. Hungary has a lot of springs with flouride in them, and the bottled water can be really bad tasting, if your're not used to the taste.
Fluoridation of water is directly related with calcification of the pineal gland in your brain. In the USA, where water is fluoridated,  most Americans will have their pineal gland completely calcified by age 30. Pineal gland is known to take part in controlling sleep cycles among other things. Sodium Fluoride is also the main ingredient in most rat poisons. Look it up I'm to lazy for sources it's a Saturday.
